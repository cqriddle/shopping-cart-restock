# shopping-cart-restock
### This is a simple cart with a restock option that pulls from a strapi database. 
#### There are still bugs needed to be fixed. The restock works but it doesn't show to item names. Working on modifying the information that is retrieved from strapi so that that data is the same format as the code.
